Artifficial Intelligence and Computer Vision project

Using a camera connected to the device (laptop camera) and using the opencv library to display it on the screen.

COMPUTER VISION PART
We show cards with different pictures and click a button to have the program save the current frame from the camera (or program it somehow so that a gesture or, for example, numbers on the cards trigger the saving of this frame).

AI PART
The AI will recognize objects from the saved photo from the camera or will indicate which number there is, e.g. a cat (the latter option is probably easier because it is enough to train the model to recognize only one thing - let's say a cat and, for example, if the probability is more than 70%, then AI indicates that there is a cat in this image.
